# Clash.gg Item Sniper

## This is a work in progress. It is not yet functional.

This is a simple script that will automatically purchase items from the Clash.gg store as soon as they become available, if the price is below a certain threshold.
Probably add functionality to automatically sell items as well.

### Usage
 - Install Node.js v12 or higher

 - Fill your Clash.gg "refresh_token" cookie into .env as REFRESH_TOKEN
 - Fill your Clash.gg "cf_clearance" cookie into .env as CF_CLEARANCE
 - Run `npm install`
